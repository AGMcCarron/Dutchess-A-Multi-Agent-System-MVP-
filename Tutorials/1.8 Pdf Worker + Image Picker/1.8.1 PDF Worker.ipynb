    "If we wanted to create a chatbot that is able to retrieve images from a textbook or a repository we give it based on that images relevance to the user query how would we do that? This jupyter notebook goes over the first part of that process. We extract images from a pdf, we then feed these images to openai to provide us with a description of the image, we then store the images in a folder and then the descriptions in a seperate folder as a .json file. We'll then use these descriptions in the Image Picker Jupyter Notebook to find the image of all of them which is most relevant to our user query.  We start by importing several modules, os gives us access to file paths, fitz allows for the opening of pdf documements, PIL's Image module allows for the opening of images, io allows for the conversion of input types, base64 allows us to upload images to openai, requests allows for requests from a url, json allows for the creation and interpretation of .json files."

We then loop through all the files in the image_directory folder and call the encode_image function on each one as we create a \"payload\" to send to openai. This payload contains everything we need to send for the message including a token limit. This token limit limits how many tokens are used by the chatbot in processing the image, this is important as image interpretation can be quite costly if left unchecked. We then send our payload by calling requests.post which then outputs the chatbots response which we store in a variable. We then extract just the text from the response and add it to a list called descriptions. We use a short amount of words to decrease the time taken for the model to produce an answer and to increase the accuracy of our retrieval system in the Image Picker document."
