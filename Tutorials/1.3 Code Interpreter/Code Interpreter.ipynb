Note: do not press restart and run all as this will cause the chat bot to interupt itself, go through the boxes one by one."

There are two new sections of code within the following box: that is the new elif statement in the event handler's on_tool_call_delta_function, this elif is there for the case when the output of the chat bot is an image and it uses the new download_image function which grabs the image from the url and downloads it to display the image."
