# Dutchess-An-Educational-AI-MVP

**Author:** Alex McCarron  **Date:** Jul 24 - Jun 24 

## Description
This project was developed as part of a Summer Internship in 2024 and represents the culmination of work surrounding the development of a system of educational chatbots intended to act as teaching tools or substitute lecturers.  
The project showcases the progression from individual tutorial modules to a fully functional interconnected system, *Dutch* and *Dutchess*, employing OpenAI’s Assistant API within Python.

## Features
- Contains a series of tutorials (1.1–1.8) that build understanding towards the creation of *Dutch* (Durham University Teaching Chatbot).  
- Implements *Dutch V1.2*, an advanced chatbot system capable of creating new assistants, filtering resources, and logging conversations.  
- Demonstrates *Dutchess V1*, a multi-agent system able to coordinate several specialised *Dutch* assistants to handle complex user queries.  
- Each tutorial, folder, and Python script is documented with explanations of purpose and internal workings.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.9  
- openai 1.76.0  

## Structure
- **Tutorials:** Step-by-step modules introducing concepts that culminate in a functional *Dutch* system.  
- **Dutch V1.2:** The most recent and complete version of *Dutch*, featuring assistant creation, resource filtering, and conversation logging.  
- **Dutchess V1:** Built using several *Dutch V1.2* agents, designed to dynamically allocate user queries across specialised chatbots.  

## How to Run
Each subfolder includes its own README explaining the purpose of its scripts and subdirectories.  

To understand or recreate the system workflow:
1. Begin with the **Tutorials** folder, working through versions 1.1 to 1.8.  
2. Explore **Dutch V1.2** to see the integrated chatbot framework.  
3. Run **Dutchess V1** to observe the coordination of multiple chatbots in action.  

All scripts include inline comments and explanations for clarity.
